        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>local storage, as I understand it, is the ability to save the work of
            the web user. This can be usefull for many reasons:</p>
        <br>
        <li>Saving the web users inputs and calling it up just in case the websignt
            crashes of something else happens. You may want an automatic save for 
            something like this.
        </li>
        <li>Save personal information for easy future access. address, mode of payment, etc...
        </li>
        <p>This is done using JavaScript. The code starts with 'localStorage' then a .action 
            to show what action you want to use with the local storage. You will need to use the
            'id' key in the HTML code to specifiy what you will be saving.
        </p>
