        <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                An initail check and an important feature of good user experience. Alows the
                user to fix the incalid data cought on the client-side straight away. 

                This should not replace exhaustive security measures. You should always perform
                security checks on any form-submitted data on the serer-side as well as the client-side.
                client-side validation is too easy to bypass.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Client-side Validation</h3>
            <p>Form validation: uses HTML5 form validation features. Generally doesn't
                require much JavaScript and has a better performance. Not as customizable.
            </p>
            <li>required: specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can
                be submitted.
            </li>
            <li>minlength/maxlength: specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</li>
            <li>min/max: specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.</li>
            <li>type: specifies whether the data needs to be a number, email address, or some other
                specific preset type.
            </li>
            <li>pattern: specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
            <p>JavaScript: uses JavaScript and is completely customizable but you need to 
                create it all.
