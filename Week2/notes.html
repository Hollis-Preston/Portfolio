        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>Ch2: Programming Basics </h2>
        <div>
            <li>You can make single line comments with "//",
                or you can create paragraph comments with "/* */".
            </li>
            <li>Each statment is compleated either by a new line
                or a ";" at the end. You can even have two statments
                on the same line when the ";" is used.
            </li>
            <li>Variables are deturmend by three key words:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>var makes a global variable.</li>
                    <li>const prevents the variable from ever being changed.</li>
                    <li>let creates a variable that is only accessable withen
                        its block.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>In strings, use "\" to include symbols are create commands.</li>
        </div>
        <h2>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <div>
            <li>Arrays names are created the same way as variables but are set
                equal to "[]".
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>To add to a list, you just place the number position in
                        the list brackets, "[]", and set it equal to the item.
                        Keep in mind you can overwrite already existing items
                        this way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Removing items from the list uses the keyword "delete"
                        infront of the list, then stating which item you want 
                        removed: delete list[3];
                    </li>
                    <li>Destructuring an aray alows you to create multiple variables
                        using an aray: let [x,y] = [1,2];
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If statments are created using the words if, else if, and else, ending
                with "{}" with the code inside.
            </li>
            <li>Switch operators are used to test conditions. There are 4 key words:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>switch - starts the statement and accepts what is being checked:
                        switch (variable){}
                    </li>
                    <li>case - located inside the switch brackets and checks if the switch
                        parameter equals something: case "yes":
                    </li>
                    <li>break - ends the statement</li>
                    <li>default - if no criteria is met. This is usually found at the ending
                        of the statement.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>While loops will repete code until while a condition is met: while (condition){}</li>
            <li>do...while loops will start the code before checking for the condition: do {} while (condition)</li>
            <li>For loops will repet code untill a condition is satisfied: 
                for (initialization; condition; after) {}
            </li>
        </div>
    </body>
