        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>Ch 8: Forms</h2>
        <h3>Form controls</h3>
        <div>
            <p>forms are made up of 'form' elements. Forms contain controls such as
                input fields, select menus and buttons. Of these we can submit it 
                serverside where the information would be processed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Forms can be accessed in javascript using document.forms[#]. Every form
                gets colected into this list in the order they appear in the markup. However,
                it may be eaiser to use the forms name rather than to know their order number.
                document.forms['name']. Keep in mind that these forms are set into variables.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
        <div>
            <li>form.submit() method submits the form automatically.</li>
            <li>type='submit' attribute on a button or input requires manual submission.</li>
            <li>form.reset() method resets all from controls back to their initial values.
                This can also be done with a button that has a type='reset' attribute. However,
                reset buttons are fround uppon
            </li>
            <li>form.action = '/an/other.url' sends the information to a different URL to be processed.</li>
        </div>
        <h2>ch 12: Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
        <div>
            <p>OOP is made up of three concepts:</p>
            <li>Encapsulation-The user can eaisly run the program without needing to know the "inner workings of the code."</li>
            <li>Polymorphism-Each object function in the same way and can be compatable with other code.</li>
            <li>Inheritance-Instead of creating something similar to an already existing object, implemet it 
                into you new code.
            </li>
        </div>
        <h3>Constructor functions</h3>
        <div>
            <p>A function that defines the properties and methods of an object. It implements the keyword 'this'
                to signify that the variable will be returned by the constructor function. This function will be
                used for the constructor property, which all objects have.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Static Methods</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                If you put the word 'static' infront of the function, it allows you to call it from the class directly
                rather than by instances of the class. However, these functions are not available to instances of the
                class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <div>
            <p>This is a handy way for accessing and/or changing properties and functions in a class.</p>
            <li>class.prototype.variable = 'value' - Sets its variable value.</li>
            <li>class.prototype.function = function(){code} - Sets its function.</li>
            <li>Object.getPrototypeOf(object_name) - Finds the prototype of an object.</li>
            <li>class.prototype.isPrototypeOf(object_name) - returns a boolean to check if its the prototype of
                an instance
            </li>
            <li>object_name.hasOwnProperty('') - checks to see if an attribute is unique or inherited.</li>
            <li></li>
        </div>
    </body>
