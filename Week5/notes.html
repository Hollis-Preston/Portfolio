        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>Ch 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <div>
            <li>System error: there's a problem with the system or external decices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error: the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic.</li>
            <li>User error: the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to use.</li>
        </div>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <div>
            <p>An error that produces a return value that can be used by the program to deal with the error.
                A Stack trace also alows the program know where the error occured.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Wasrnings occure if there is an error in the code but is not enough to cause the program to fail.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>'use strict'</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
                Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode'.
            </p>
            <li>To implement strict mode, simply use the string 'use strict'; on the first line in your javaScript code.</li>
        </div>
        <h3>alert()</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Alert stops a program from runing untill OK is clicked which allows us to effectively put breakpoints in
                the code that allows us to see any message/variables we want.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>console</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Console provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. However, alert()
                is recomended over this.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>try, catch, finally</h3>
        <div>
            <li>try: try running on the following program</li>
            <li>catch: If the program had issues running, report an error and run any listed code.</li>
            <li>finally: runs code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.</li>
        </div>
    </body>
